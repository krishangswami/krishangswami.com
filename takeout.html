            The aim of this project was to design a Take-Out Box for food.
            <br><br>
            As a class project, the box had many restrictions;<br />
            "You may use up to 3 separate pieces of E-flute cardboard.
            All pieces must be able to come from a single 18 x 24" sheet.
            No fasteners (nails, screws, etc.) or glue may be used. Tabs and slots should be used to connect sections within the design."
            <br>
            My final design encoprated tabs and was made from one piece of cardboard. It had a triangular shape and a flat back for easy holding.
            These shapes added to the stability, strength and grip of the box.
