                    Hi, I am an Interaction Design student at the University of Washington.
                    <br><br>
                    My journey so far has been interesting to say the least. Growing up in India and studying at an international boarding school exposed me to many cultures and a rich variety of experiences. I learned to appreciate novel and diverse perspectives and developed a desire to learn the unfamiliar.
                    Consequently, I explored and decided to major in something versatile; design.
                    <br><br>
                    Many aspects of techonlogy have become a fundamental part of being human and emerging technologies are currently shaping our lives. As Designers, our work embodies the future, so, I want to be sure to innovate towards a positive impact by working on meaningful problems and challenging projects.
                </p>
