                    My Dad used to call me a jack of all trades but master of none, however, my curiosity has led me to a rich variety of experiences.

                    <br><br>Studying in an international boarding school in India for 11 years exposed me to many cultures. I learned to appreciate novel and diverse perspectives and developed a desire to work to connect all fields. Consequently, I explored
                    and then decided to major in something versatile; design.

                    <br><br>Many of us want to 'make the world a better place.' Emerging technologies are currently shaping our future and as a self-proclaimed intellectual, constantly questioning the status quo is a habit. I genuinely care about human
                    societies and so want to be sure to innovate towards a positive impact by working on meaningful projects.
