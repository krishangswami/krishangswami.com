                    My Dad used to call me a jack of all trades but master of none. I feel, however, that my curiosity has led me to a rich variety of experiences.

                    <br><br>Studying in an international boarding school for 11 years exposed me to many cultures. I learned to appreciate novel and varied perspectives. Consequently, I explored and then decided to major in design, which I consider the
                    bridge between all fields.

                    <br><br>We all want to 'make the world a better place.' Emerging technologies are currently shaping our future and as someone with an abstract mind and who constantly questions the status quo, I want to be sure to innovate towards
                    a positive impact on human societies by working on meaningful projects.
