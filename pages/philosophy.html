                    My Dad used to call me a jack of all trades but master of none. I feel, however, that my curiosity has led me to a rich variety of experiences.

                    <br><br>Studying in an international boarding school for 11 years exposed me to many cultures. I learned to appreciate novel and varied perspectives. This led me to explore and then major in design, which I consider as the bridge between
                    all fields.

                    <br><br>We all want to 'make the world a better place.' As someone who constantly questions the status quo, I want to innovate towards positive impact by working on meaningful projects for the development of human societies.
