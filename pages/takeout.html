                    The aim of this project was to design a take-out box for food.
                    <br><br>As a class project, the design had many restrictions: <br>
                    <p3>
                        "You may use up to 3 separate pieces of E-flute cardboard. All pieces must be able to come from a single 18 x 24" sheet. No fasteners (nails, screws, etc.) or glue may be used. Tabs and slots should be used to connect sections within the design."
                    </p3>
                    <br><br>The many prototypes I made, ranged from exploring origami folds and different tabs. The process of iterating new designs and versions, incrementally made my design better. Here are some images that show the process:

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    Origami folds and designs were too difficult with the E-flute cardboard. The designs finalized and iterated further had simpler folds and no curves where the cardboard would crack.
                    <br><br>For joining sides and different pieces I used tabs and supports from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://courses.washington.edu/art166sp/documents/Spring2012/lectures/week_8/CardboardTabs&SupportsHandout.pdf">here</a>.
                    <br><br>My final design includes tabs and was made from one piece of cardboard. It has a triangular shape and a flat back for a strong structure and easy holding. These shapes add stability, strength and grip to the box. Images of
                    the final design:
