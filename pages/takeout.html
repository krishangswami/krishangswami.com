                    <p3>
                        "You may use up to 3 separate pieces of E-flute cardboard. All pieces must be able to come from a single 18 x 24" sheet. No fasteners (nails, screws, etc.) or glue may be used. Tabs and slots should be used to connect sections within the design."
                    </p3>
                    <br><br>The many prototypes I made explored origami folds and different tabs. Discovery through iteration was essential to the process and incrementally made my design better.

                    I found origami folds and designs too complex for the E-flute cardboard, therefore, the designs developed further had simpler folds and no curves where the cardboard could crack.
                    <br><br>For joining sides and different pieces together I used tabs and supports from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://courses.washington.edu/art166sp/documents/Spring2012/lectures/week_8/CardboardTabs&SupportsHandout.pdf">here</a>.
                    <br><br>My final design utilized tabs and was made from one piece of cardboard. It had a triangular shape and a flat back that added stability, strength and grip to the box.
