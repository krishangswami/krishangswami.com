                    The aim of this project was to design a Take-out Box for food.
                    <br><br>As a class project, the box had many restrictions; <br>
                    <p3>
                        "You may use up to 3 separate pieces of E-flute cardboard. All pieces must be able to come from a single 18 x 24" sheet. No fasteners (nails, screws, etc.) or glue may be used. Tabs and slots should be used to connect sections within the design."
                    </p3>
                    <br><br>My final design included tabs and was made from one piece of cardboard. It had a triangular shape and a flat back for a strong structure and easy holding. These shapes added to the stability, strength and grip of the box.
                    <br><br>The process of interating new designs and versions, incremently made my design better. Here are some images that show the process:
