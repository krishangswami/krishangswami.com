                    Owning a personal car is convenient and has become an essential part of many people's lives in metropolitan cities around America. This convenience comes at a cost that many people do not take notice of. These costs include, but are not limited to, car maintenance, parking costs, land use, traffic congestion, fuel consumption, etc.
                    <br>
                    With this project, I want to show you another perspective on owning cars by focusing on the data and research I've collected.

              <h>Conclusions from research and collection</h>
                <p>
                    After going through many articles and research done by cities and other organisations, I understood that owning a car is expensive for people, cities and society as a whole. Although, cars itself aren't the problem, personal ownership of them causes allocation of resources that makes an ineffiencent system
                    <br><br>
                    Main Points:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>In metropolitan cities, cars are mostly used to commute to work. While commuting, most people travel alone to work. This is unnecessary and detrimental to the environment.</li>
                      <li>Although, cars are more comfortable and convenient, the rate of change of car ownership is decreasing as more people prefer to use more economical and ecological modes of transport. That being said, the number of cars being used is definitely not decreasing.</li>
                      <li>A lot of area within homes, public spaces and private spaces all over cities are used for parking cars. The oppurtunity cost of parking lots, garages and street parking is high as land gets more expensive.</li>
                      <li>In an average 12 hour day, cars spend the most time being parked.</li>
                      <li>In most cities across America, traffic is increasing and commute time increasing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, I believe owning a car is becoming redundant. The cost is too high, especially when other other systems can do the job better. We need a system that, in this day and age, focuses on ways to make this planet healthier and more cohesive with human ambitions and lifestyle. A system where transportation doesn't need to be a major contribution to the inefficiency of cities.

              <p>
                From the research, I subsequently decided to work on a system that focuses on the user experience in a future where car ownership is minimal.
