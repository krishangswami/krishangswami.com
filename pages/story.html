                    As a child, my Dad would call me the Jack of all trades and a master of none. I have always enjoyed doing many things and my curiosity has lead to me learn and experience a variety of things.
                    <br><br>Studying at a boarding school for 11 years with friends coming close to 30 different nationalities, I learned about many cultures and now appreciate all their differences. Over the years, I developed into a person that is intrigued
                    by and enjoys a variety of things.
                    <!-- This meant that a specific field of study and one that I initially set out to do, such as Mechanical Engineering was not suited for me. -->
                    <br><br>My diversion from a focus in engineering and my interest in creativity throughout high school, lead me to explore and then major in design. Which I consider as the bridge between all fields.
