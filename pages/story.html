                    As a child, my Dad would call me the Jack of all trades and a master of none. I have always enjoyed many activities and my curiosity has lead me to a variety of experiences.
                    <br><br>Studying in an international boarding school for 11 years with friends from across the globe, I learned about many cultures and now appreciate all their differences. Over the years, I developed into a person that is intrigued
                    by and enjoys novel and varied perspectives.
                    <br><br>My diversion from a focus in engineering and my interest in creativity throughout high school lead me to explore and then major in design, which I consider as the bridge between all fields.
