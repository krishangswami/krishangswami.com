                    Robin is a voice focused human to computer interaction system.
                    <br><br>
                    <p3>
                        This was a team project in collaboration with Peter Franko, Stella Ding, Oscar Marczyński and Johnny Knutsen.
                    </p3>
                    <br>I worked on the ideation process to finalize out the interaction and visualization, the UI of the screen, the script and the sounds to notify the driver.
                    <br><br>At first, we started with a screen that was essentially a larger phone. While working through the scripts and finalizing the flow for the video, we noticed the screen was still a distraction with its many buttons and the interaction
                    not simple enough.
                    <br><br>For the final design, we designed it in ways to remove as many distractions as possible for the driver. Through augmented reality glasses Robin shows the driver the directions on the road and the interactions with the system
                    are done through voice. This removes the need to reach out to touch or look away from the road.

                    We believe this is the right solution to remove distractions, keep functionality of a phone and make driving safer and easier.
