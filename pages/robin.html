                    Robin is a voice focused human to computer interaction system.
                    <br><br>
                    <p3>
                        This was a team project in collaboration with Peter Franko, Stella Ding, Oscar Marczyński and Johnny Knutsen.
                    </p3>
                    <br>I worked on the ideation and development process for the system interaction, particularly the projection on the road and some visualization of the dashboard screen. I also contributed by developing notification sounds and working
                    on the script for the video.
                    <br><br>At first, we started with a screen that was essentially a larger phone. While working on the script and finalizing the flow for the video, we noticed the screen was still a distraction with its many buttons and the interaction
                    not simple enough.
                    <br><br>For the final design, we removed almost all distractions for the driver. Through augmented reality glasses Robin projects the directions on the road and all the interactions with the system are done through voice. This removes
                    the need to reach out to touch a screen and look away from the road.

                    We believed this was a good solution that removed distractions, kept the functionality needed and made driving safer and easier.
