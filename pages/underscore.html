                <p>This is a personal project that aims to solve a simple problem in current ways of news curation.
                    <br><br> The problem with the way that we get news today is that the article or video you come across, most likely has a view that you will agree with. Platforms such as Facebook show you news based on your friend-circle, location
                    and other factors. This biased way of curation generates more readers and clicks.
                    <br><br> To solve this, the Underscore would be a platform where a viewer could find a group of articles or videos that show different approaches and viewpoints on a particular topic.
