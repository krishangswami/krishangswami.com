                    On average an American spends <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/">10 hours and 39 minutes</a> each day looking at screens to consume media. I decided demostrate the 'fare for playing' on the internet by gathering data from multiple sources, designing and then making a website that juxtaposes different types of information.
                    <br><br>
                    Playfare is a project that visualizes data from different sources. The main aspect of the visualization is to show the viewer the evident change happening around the world while he/she is watching.

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    The process started with ideating different visualizations of the finalized data via drawings and simple wireframing on Sketch. The next step was figuring out which one would be the most effective.<br><br>
                    A turning point in the design of the website was when, during class critique, I was advised the juxtaposition of different data would deliver the impact I wanted.<br><br>
                    After concluding upon the less complex version I started making the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery. While making the website minor design changes and further design decisions relating to active website interactions had to be made to make it intuitive.
                    <br><br>
                    The website is also made and designed to be responsive to screen sizes and is live at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.playfare.world">www.playfare.world</a>.
