                  During my time as an intern at HBO I worked as a designer for the digital products section of the company. I learned how to work with the Agile methodology by actively participating in Sprints as a part of 2 teams over the 10 weeks. Within these teams I worked with full-time designers on design decisions, interface iterations and user testing.
                  <br><br>
                  Additionally, I experimented on user experiences with AI assistants and was given a main project; redesigning the desktop versions of HBO's digital products.
                  <br><br>
                  With the help of senior designers at the company, a fellow design intern and I started the design process for hbogo.com and hbonow.com. In general, the project was heavily focused on the user experience and structure of the website and not the minor interface details. This was due to the guidelines and timeline given.
                  <br><br>
                  After getting an understanding of HBO's business and design principles we started with speculative explorations for what the future of the product could be. Throughout the 10 weeks we had many meetings with designers and engineers and our iterations went through many rounds of critique. The project was scoped many times as depths of certain directions increased and as we prioritised the problems we wanted to solve. In the end, we proposed one focused direction of the base structure and 3 similar alternatives.
