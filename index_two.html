              This class project was done in collaboration with Alexis Bieda and Peter Franko.
              The project explores modes to reduce consumption of energy and water in the house setting.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/homeo/first.png" alt="">
            <p>
              The project started by understanding current market solutions that reduce consumption. We then interviewed a family to get a grasp of the interaction space to see if we could provide technical assistance to improve the situation and reduce utility costs.
            </p>

            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/homeo/storyboard.png" alt="">
            <p>
              The process includes some storyboarding and defining the characteristics of our interaction system which we hoped would enable users to understand and change habits to curtail their environmental impact and utility costs.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/homeo/process.png" alt="">
            <p>
              Although our initial approach had functional ideas, our system of interfaces lacked cohesion and worked without a focused purpose. So, we started looking into the essentials and the core factors that would help the users save money and energy.
            <!-- </p> -->
            <!-- <p> --><br><br>
              We figured that using a fixed point of reference set by the user, to determine the relative consumption level, would help them easily track their habits and give them autonomy over their progress.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/homeo/receptors.png" alt="">
            <p>
              The small portable screens (receptors) were designed to provide constant usage feedback to the user of a particular appliance. The appliance monitored would be suggested on the connected app through the habits that the system understands.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/homeo/application_two.png" alt="">
            <p>
              The designed mobile application includes onboarding that explains how the usage will be tracked, what the goal of machine learning is and how the system of interfaces can be used.
              <!-- <br><br> -->
              The home screen emphasizes on alerts and the appliances in the house are organized by their relative consumption. The simple menu allows for quick access to adding receptors, establishing goals and general settings.
              <br><br>
              The video demonstrates the process of using Homeo and how it can help guide users to a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective life.

            <p>
               At HBO I worked as a User Experience designer for the digital products team at the company. I worked with 2 teams; Purchase/Identity and Foundation. I actively participated in sprints, experimented on experiences with AI assistants and worked closely with the designers on design decisions, iterations of interfaces and user testing.
               <br><br>Although I participated in different aspects of design, my main focus for the 10 weeks was redesigning the desktop version of HBO's digital products.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/first.png" alt="">
            <p>
              Project Goals:
              <br><br>
              Redesign the shell model for desktop: shell model consists of containers inside which the content can live that enables the users to flow through the platform.
              <br><br>
              Explore interstitial states: a state that comes in between the hover and the asset detail page to provide more context of particular assets.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/current_sitemap.png" alt="">
            <p>
              On the current site, the loading of a new page on every click is a lengthy back and forth process to explore content. This creates a big jump in the information provided to the user from hover to the asset detail page.
              <br><br>
              On the proposed site, incremental information at different stages will curtail the drill-in/drill-out. This means that both more functionality and more stages, such as the interstitial, would improve the tiresome and inefficient process that limits the user from exploring content.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/proposed_sitemap.png" alt="">
            <p>
              We explored different navigation models by creating wireframes that represented the general layout of the website.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/sitemap_one.png" alt="">
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/sitemap_two.png" alt="">
            <p>
              The main approach was to identify and focus on the unique strengths of the desktop experience. The goal of the developed shell model was also to make sure the users could explore the content easily without having to commit to an asset and express the breadth of categories.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/final_sitemap.png" alt="">
            <p>
              The next step in the process included more detailed work into figuring out exactly what functionality and information would be available in different parts/stages of the website.
              <br><br>
              For the navigation, considering our finalized shell model for the website, we narrowed down to a couple of models.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/navigation_options.png" alt="">
            <p>
              With much consideration of what incremental information needs to be provided through the 3 possible stages of an asset (hover, interstitial and full page), these stages were finalized upon.
              <br><br>
              Although, after being told that the specific details of where certain information and metadata would be placed are a consideration for a longer project timeline, the focus was drawn to the practicality of the broader website structure and how we could best convey the biggest factors of the redesign.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/carousels.png" alt="">
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/hover_tiles.png" alt="">
            <p>
              After exploring certain features of the hover stage, the next step, and the most complex part of the project was the interstitial or the stage between hover and the asset detail page.
              <br><br>
              For this we briefly explored 3 narrowed down possibilities. Due to reasons such as reducing information overload and the drill-in/drill-out process and embracing the strengths of the desktop, we decided to move forward with 'carousel zoom'.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/carousel_zoom.png" alt="">
            <p>
              Carousel zoom allows users to have a selective focus and emphasizes the content while making sure the user can still quickly browse through the carousels on the home page.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/hbo/detailed_zoom.png" alt="">
            <p>
              We put the details together to be able to tell the story of what we redesigned and made an Invision prototype to convey a walkthrough and make certain aspects less confusing.

            <p>
              The process started with ideating different visualizations of the finalized data via drawings and simple wireframing on Sketch. The next step was figuring out which one would be the most effective and how juxtaposing certain factors could be more impactful.
              <br><br>
              After concluding upon the less complex version I started making the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery. While making the website minor design changes and further design decisions relating to active website interactions had to be made to make it intuitive.

              "How might we preserve human life in Seattle in the aftermath of a megathrust earthquake?"
              <br><br>

              From the insights, we had to further define what was necessary from our findings. This process led to the design principles which fundamentally revolved around helping civilians as opposed government policymakers or first responders. Our design principles directed our further steps to bring about a solution to the problems we understood.

              Our concepts revolved around our design principles and our given restriction to work in the field of biometrics.

              On further developing one of the concepts, we tested out a prototype. It was a behavioral/wizard-of-oz prototype, and our focus was on people interacting with the prototype and their organic reactions to it.

              We then created an MVP to showcase what we conceptualized and created an 'advertisement' to tell the story of how the concept would be used in a disaster scenario.

              The Underscore is a personal project of a platform that provides the reader a collection of articles and videos that features a range of perspectives on a topic. This would essentially allow readers to create their own opinion based on multiple sources.

              The biggest problem with how we receive news today is that the content lies within our comfort zone. Platforms such as Facebook curate news towards a user based on the preferences of their circle of friends, location, browsing history, etc. This biased way of curation generates more readers and clicks but often provides just one side of a multifaceted story.
            </p>
            <img class="full_img" src="files/images/underscore/research.png" alt="">
            <p>
              I explored wireframing simple versions of the website and then slowly adding defined changes. I wanted to keep the design simple and keep the focus on the content.
            </p>

            <p>
              The underscore would be a weekly updated news curator that features varied perspectives on a topic. This would enable the reader to see multiple sides to a story.
              <br><br>
              With the website, I had to consider interaction design functions such as mouse hover, mouse clicks, and animations to make sure the usage of the website would be intuitive. I made the first prototype and the latest iteration of the design using my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery.
